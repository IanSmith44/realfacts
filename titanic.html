            The Titanic Switch Theory: Uncovering the Greatest Maritime Mystery
          </h1>
          <h4>Disparities in Portholes and Windows</h4>
          <p>
            Proponents of the Titanic switch theory argue that the famed RMS
            Titanic and its sister ship, the RMS Olympic, were swapped in an
            elaborate insurance scam. Various pieces of evidence have been
            presented over the years, fueling this controversial theory.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most cited discrepancies involves the number of
            portholes. The Olympic originally had 16 portholes, while the
            Titanic had 14. Photographs of the Titanic in dry dock clearly show
            it with 14 portholes. However, by the time of its ill-fated maiden
            voyage, the Titanic had acquired 16 portholes, just like the
            Olympic. This change raises questions: were these additional
            portholes part of aesthetic modifications, or were they evidence of
            the ship swap?
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the spacing of the windows between the two ships
            provides another clue. The Olympic's windows were unevenly spaced,
            whereas the Titanic's were evenly spaced. Yet, by the maiden voyage,
            the Titanic’s windows had adopted the uneven spacing characteristic
            of the Olympic.
          </p>
          <h4>List to Port: An Unseen Damage</h4>
          <p>
            The Olympic suffered a collision with the HMS Hawke, resulting in a
            permanent 2-degree list to port. The undamaged Titanic should not
            have had this list. However, Lawrence Beesley, a second-class
            passenger who survived the Titanic sinking, reported that the ship
            listed to port. Beesley, a science teacher and reliable observer,
            stated,
            <span class="quote"
              >"The Titanic listed to port...It was plain she did so, for the
              sky-line and sea on the port side were visible most of the time
              and on the starboard only sky."</span
            >
            This observation suggests that the Titanic might have had the same
            structural issues as the Olympic.
          </p>
          <h4>Rumors Amongst the Crew</h4>
          <p>
            During the Titanic's launch, a nationwide coal strike left thousands
            of firemen, boiler stokers, and greasers out of work. Despite this,
            the Titanic struggled to find a crew, with many men refusing to work
            on the ship. Rumors circulated among workers at Harland and Wolff
            shipyard that the ships had been swapped as part of an insurance
            scam and that the Titanic was intended to be sunk. This supposed
            foreknowledge may have deterred workers from boarding the ship.
          </p>
          <h4>Notable Last-Minute Cancellations</h4>
          <p>
            Several high-profile passengers canceled their trips on the Titanic
            at the last minute, raising suspicions of prior knowledge. J.P.
            Morgan, the financier who owned the White Star Line's parent
            company, canceled his trip days before departure, citing illness.
            However, a New York Times reporter discovered that Morgan was seen
            in France with his mistress on the day the Titanic sank. Other
            prominent figures, such as industrialist Henry Clay Frick, banker
            Horace J. Harding, and billionaire George Washington Vanderbilt,
            also canceled at the last minute, all of whom were connected to
            Morgan.
          </p>
          <h4>The Mysterious SS Californian</h4>
          <p>
            The SS Californian, also owned by J.P. Morgan, played a
            controversial role in the Titanic disaster. It carried no passengers
            and had 3,000 woolen blankets and jumpers. The Californian steamed
            into the middle of the Atlantic, stopped, and waited. Survivor Edith
            Russell claimed Titanic officers assured her the Californian was on
            its way. However, due to navigation errors, the Californian stopped
            12 miles away from the Titanic, unable to rescue passengers, leading
            to the tragic loss of approximately 1,500 lives.
          </p>
          <h4>The Wreck and Its Revelations</h4>
          <p>
            The Titanic's wreck was discovered by Robert Ballard in 1985. Some
            findings from the wreck support the switch theory. The stamp "401,"
            the ID number for the Titanic at Harland and Wolff, is visible on
            the Titanic’s propeller. Some authors suggest this propeller was
            fitted to the Olympic after its collision with the Hawke, indicating
            the wreck might actually be the Olympic.
          </p>
          <p>
            What appear to be the letters "M" and "P" are visible on the side of
            the wreck, possibly remnants of the name "OLYMPIC" covered over with
            "TITANIC." The wreck also shows traces of gray paint used as an
            undercoat on the Olympic, whereas the Titanic used black paint.
          </p>
          <h4>Lack of Media Scrutiny</h4>
          <p>
            Insurance scams and maritime fraud were common in the early 20th
            century. The lack of extensive media coverage in 1912 makes the
            Titanic switch theory more plausible. Only one film of the Titanic
            exists, and the photographic record is limited. Given the extreme
            similarity between the two ships, only the most attentive observers
            would have noticed the swap.
          </p>
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            While the Titanic switch theory remains a contentious topic, the
            discrepancies in physical evidence and the unusual circumstances
            surrounding the ship's maiden voyage continue to intrigue
            researchers and conspiracy theorists alike.
