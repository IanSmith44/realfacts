          <h2>Did the Titanic Really Ever Sink?</h2>
          <h6>
            Proponents of the swap theory have pointed out disparities in the
            number of portholes on the ships. The Olympic had 16 and the Titanic
            had 14. Photographs taken of the Titanic in dry dock show it with 14
            portholes. But by the time of its doomed maiden voyage it now had
            16, just like the Olympic. Was this evidence that the ships had been
            swapped or just that they had added two extra portholes as part of
            aesthetic changes to the Titanic? During construction — top, Titanic
            had 14 portholes. By its maiden voyage — bottom, it had 16 Other
            evidence supports the switch ,  the windows on the Olympic were
            somewhat unevenly spaced, but more evenly spaced on the Titanic.
            Again, by the time of its maiden voyage, the Titanic had acquired
            unevenly spaced windows like the Olympic. List to port
          </h6>
          <h6>
            The damage to the Olympic after its collision with the Hawke lent it
            a noticeable and permanent 2˚ list to port. The undamaged Titanic
            had no such list. Lawrence Beesley reported the Titanic listed to
            port like the Olympic However, one second-class passenger who
            survived the sinking -  Lawrence Beesley, later reported the Titanic
            did, in fact, list to port, stating "the Titanic listed to port...It
            was plain she did so, for the sky-line and sea on the port side were
            visible most of the time and on the starboard only sky". Beesley, a
            science teacher, was considered a reliable observer, and would later
            write one of the first books about the Titanic disaster. Rumours
            amongst crew
          </h6>
          <h6>
            There was a nationwide coal strike during the launch of the Titanic,
            leading to thousands of firemen, boiler stokers and greasers short
            of work. Yet despite this the Titanic struggled to find crew, with
            many men refusing to work on the ship at any price. Rumours were
            circulating amongst the workers at Harland and Wolff that the ships
            had been swapped as part of an insurance scam, and Titanic was to be
            sunk. Did foreknowledge of the sinking of the Titanic frighten men
            off from wanting to work on the ship? Titanic during its
            construction at the Harland and Wolff shipyard, Belfast Despite the
            immense fanfare and hype that surrounded the Titanic launch, it was
            only just over half full when it left Southampton on its doomed
            voyage. Did White Star want to minimise the number of passengers
            because it intended to scuttle the ship? Or had the rumours of the
            insurance scam spread outside of the shipyards? Several last minute
            cancellations from high profile passengers certainly suggest some
            kind of foreknowledge. Last minute cancellations
          </h6>
          <h6>
            Many of the richest and most prestigious names in early 20th-century
            society were booked onto the Titanic. JP Morgan  -  the
            international financier who owned the White Star’s parent company,
            was due to travel on the Titanic but cancelled his trip a few days
            before the departure, claiming illness. JP Morgan and other
            prominent figures cancelled at the last minute A New York Times
            reported discovered this to be a lie, Morgan was actually seen
            perfectly well with his mistress in France on the very day Titanic
            sunk. Industrialist Henry Clay Frick and his wife, banker Horace J.
            Harding and billionaire George Washington Vanderbilt - all connected
            to Morgan, were amongst several other prominent figures who
            cancelled at the last minute. Californian
          </h6>
          <h6>
            The SS Californian, also owned by JP Morgan, was a large passenger
            ship that was ultimately blamed for the loss of life on the Titanic.
            It behaved somewhat oddly around the time of the Titanic’s voyage.
            Carrying no passengers,  it steamed into the middle of the Atlantic,
            stopped and waited. It’s only cargo was 3000 woollen blankets and
            jumpers. What was the purpose behind this curious manoeuvre? Was the
            Californian intended to rescue the Titanic’s passengers after its
            deliberate sinking? Edith Russell, a survivor of the sinking, was
            adamant that Titanic officers assured her the Californian was on its
            way. Author Robin Gardiner suggests serious navigation errors lead
            to the Californian stopping in the wrong area, some 12 miles away
            from the Titanic. The lifeboats on the Titanic weren’t sufficient to
            save all the passengers With the Californian unable to complete its
            rescue mission the Titanic was doomed, and some 1500 passengers and
            crew perished in one of the worst maritime disasters in modern
            history. The wreck
          </h6>
          <h6>
            The wreck of the Titanic was discovered by Robert Ballard in 1985.
            Some evidence from the wreck supports the switch theory. The stamp
            401,  the ID number used for the Titanic at Harland and Wolff, can
            be seen on the Titanic’s propeller. However, some authors have
            suggested that the Titanic propeller was fitted to the Olympic
            during its repair following the collision with the Hawke. If true,
            this would be strong evidence that the vessel on the ocean floor was
            really the Olympic. The wreck of the Titanic was found by Robert
            Ballard in 1985 What appear to be the letters M and P can also be
            seen on the side of the wreck. Could that be the remains of the
            ship's original etched nameplate -  ‘OLYMPIC’, covered over with the
            Titanic’s as part of the scam The wreck appears to show some
            evidence of the grey paint used as an undercoat on the Olympic. The
            Titanic used black paint for its undercoat. Lack of media scrutiny
          </h6>
          <h6>
            Insurance scams and maritime fraud were common at the time of the
            Titanic’s sinking. Whilst it seems unlikely such a scam could be
            pulled off today, the lack of media coverage in 1912 makes it more
            credible. Only one film survives of the Titanic and the photo record
            is also scant. With the two ships extremely similar, it is argued
            that only the most eagle-eyed would ever have spotted the swap.
