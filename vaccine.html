            Do covid vaccines contain nanoparticles that self-assemble to build
            a biocircuitry "operating system" to control your moods and
            thoughts?
          </h2>
          <h6>
            Some covid vaccines contain exotic technology that, once injected
            into the body, activates a self-assembly process to build a
            biocircuitry interface using elements from the victim's own blood.
            This sounds like science fiction, but we are living in a dystopian
            sci-fi world with biological weapons, magnetic nanoparticle
            magnetofection technology, Orwellian surveillance and all-out
            government propaganda to coerce everyone into taking a depopulation
            spike protein injection.
          </h6>
          <h6>
            In addition, the Moderna company openly describes their vaccine
            injections as installing an "operating system," which by definition
            means a platform to receive additional commands or instructions for
            execution. How are those commands received? From external
            electromagnetic waves?
          </h6>
          <h6>
            Dr. Peter McCullogh has described vaccine-pushing doctors as being
            in a kind of mind-controlled trance. His exact words from a recent
            interview: What we have learned over time is that we could no longer
            communicate with government agencies. We actually couldn’t
            communicate with our propagandized colleagues in major medical
            centers, all of which appear to be under a spell, almost as if
            they’ve been hypnotized... Good doctors are doing unthinkable things
            like injecting biologically active messenger RNA that produces this
            pathogenic spike protein into pregnant women. I think when these
            doctors wake up from their trance, they’re going to be shocked to
            think what they’ve done to people... There’s a video where he states
            this: It isn't a spell or a trance but rather a self-assembled,
            embedded biocircuit that has taken control over their neurology!
          </h6>
          <h6>
            Some vaccines are simple spike protein bioweapons injections, but
            other vaccines are designed to place people in a kind of "trance"
            where elements of their neurology are controlled through external
            signals and commands. Never forget this published research:
            Superparamagnetic nanoparticle delivery of DNA vaccine. The
            efficiency of delivery of DNA vaccines is often relatively low
            compared to protein vaccines. The use of superparamagnetic iron
            oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to deliver genes via magnetofection
            shows promise in improving the efficiency of gene delivery both in
            vitro and in vivo. That same study reveals the only two elements
            necessary to create "SPIONS" (magnetic nanoparticles) are Iron and
            Oxygen, both present in human blood: We describe the production of
            Fe3O4-based SPIONs with high magnetization values (70 emu/g) under
            15 kOe of the applied magnetic field at room temperature...
          </h6>
          <h6>
            Polyethylenimine was chosen to modify the surface of SPIONs to
            assist the delivery of plasmid DNA into mammalian cells due to the
            polymer's extensive buffering capacity through the "proton sponge"
            effect. This is the same as a self-assembling nanotech biocircuitry
            system, it hints at the existence of exotic technologies that are
            exploring such approaches to controlling neurology via external
            influences (such as electromagnetic fields). Such technology exists
            and is being deployed right now, it explains the seeming "hypnosis"
            or "trance" under which millions of people suffer as they continue
            to demand more bioweapons injections into children and pregnant
            women. Today's doctors are just brainwashed, gullible cowards who
            care nothing if they harm or kill billions of people as long as they
            don't lose their lucrative medical salaries. Will people ever wake
            up from this trance and realize they've become vaccine murderers?
